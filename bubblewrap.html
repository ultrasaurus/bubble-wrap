      <h3><font color="#336699">What is the purpose of interactive multimedia?</font></h3>
      <p><font color="#336699">by Sarah Allen </font></p>
      <p>I first encountered <a href="http://www.kode-fu.com/resume/VBW.html">Virtual
          Bubble Wrap</a> during the early days of Shockwave in the mid-1990s.
          A strangely compelling game that allowed a person to roll the mouse
          over a sheet of simulated bubble wrap yielding gratifying popping sounds
          and visuals. After popping all the bubbles, you would achieve the next
          level, identical to the first. For an added twist, the game kept score.
          This added to my amusement rather than driving bubble-popping achievement,
          since the pure pleasure of popping bubbles was sufficient entertainment.
          For me, this was a completely unexpected exploration of the medium.</p>
      <p>While Virtual Bubble Wrap remained one of my all-time favorite Shockwave
        sites, it receded to the back of my consciousness until 1997. Flash 3
        has just been released, and the URL of a <a href="http://www.urban75.com/Mag/bubble.html">Flash
        Virtual Bubble Wrap</a> crossed my in-box. This version did not keep
        score or maintain bubble-state, yet was a testament to Flash's arrival
        as a true interactive multimedia player. </p>
      <p>I almost chalked up this phenomenon to the artist's drive to re-create
        -- imitation is, after all, the highest form of flattery. Across the
        hall, a colleague exclaimed &quot;hey, I found one in DHMTL!&quot; A
        quick web-search revealed a <a href="http://www.virtualbubblewrap.com/">Java</a> version,
        as well. It felt oddly familiar as I recalled some computer graphics
        history.</p>
      <h3>A bit of history</h3>
      <p>In the 1970s when 3D computer graphics was new, there was much research
        into modeling and rendering algorithms, figuring out how computers could
        create the illusion of three-dimensions on a flat screen by changing
        the intensity of a given pixel. Grad students sought models that would
        demonstrate how well their algorithms handled curves and other challenges.
        One particular grad student, Martin Newell, discussed his concern over
        a lack of good models with his wife over tea one day. Sandra suggested
        he model their tea set. With graph paper and pencil, the teapot was introduced
        into virtual reality, where it became a favorite data set for students
        and professionals all over the world.</p>
      <p><img src="newell_teapot_sm.png" width="288" height="192" align="right">The
        teapot model not only created a warm, friendly image, but it was a great
        test case. It had convex and concave surfaces. It had a spout that jutted
        out to one side, a knob on top and a handle, creating &quot;saddle points,&quot; hidden
        surfaces, and other fun stuff.</p>
      <p>It struck me that Virtual Bubble Wrap is to interactive multimedia what
        the teapot is to 3D computer graphics. It is a fun game that can be implemented
        with no rules. It's best features are pure multimedia experience. It
        uses sound, animation, different graphical states, and interactivity.
        Advanced versions may add score keeping and persistent state.</p>
      <p>I later learned from Dave Groff, credited with &quot;concept and game
        design,&quot; that the first Virtual Bubble Wrap was originally created
        in Supercard in 1993 for a promotional diskette called &quot;The Mackerel
        Stack.&quot; Original code was written by Karl Borst and Kevin Steele,
        and the shockwave code was written one Saturday by Joey DeVilla (master
        of code-fu).</p>
      <h3>So what about multimedia?</h3>
      <p>After establishing that Virtual Bubble Wrap is a good test case for
        interactive multimedia, it begs the question: what is the purpose of
        this medium? It took a very long time for 3D computer graphics to move
        beyond images that were more easily reproduced with camera and film.
        Today we can go to the movies, watch TV or even serve on a jury and the
        graphics can be so good that we suspend disbelief and get caught up in
        the story, unconcerned about the technology by which these images are
        created. The magic disappears and this new medium becomes an extension
        of our reality.</p>
      <p>There are some who trace the heritage and destiny of multimedia as pure
        entertainment. Certainly gaming is a significant genre. However, I see
        multimedia as an evolution of the graphical user interface. Beyond buttons,
        menus and checkboxes, multimedia is the
        development of all the software elements which exists only to facilitate
        how human
        beings interact with the machine.</p>
      <p>Apple popularized &quot;multimedia&quot; as a marketing term in the
        late '80s to describe HyperCard and later QuickTime. Interactive multimedia
        was not new. As early as 1945 in his landmark article <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm">As
        We May Think</a>, Vannevar Bush suggested that computers should work
        as the human mind does, by association. In 1951, Doug Engelbart noted
        that &quot;the difficulty of mankind's problems was increasing at a
        greater rate than our ability to cope.&quot; His Augment system that
        was in use in the 60's and 70's, was one of the first systems with a
        graphical user interface. It included text outlining and linking, as
        well as e-mail and screen sharing. In 1978, Phillips and Sony launched
        the laserdisk and with the addition of personal computers, &quot;interactive
        video&quot; was born. Although it is not implied by the name, hypertext
        and other non-linear navigation is considered part of the medium. These
        and other early efforts might have been called interactive multimedia.</p>
      <p>The flurry of multimedia authoring tools released in the late 80's to
        mid-90's did not represent radical new ideas; however, they did bring
        the capability of authoring in this new medium to a larger audience than
        ever before. Tools such as HyperCard and Director enabled a large number
        of people to experiment with new models of graphical user interfaces
        and different ways of interacting with information. Many of the visual
        effects we see in modern operating systems were first seen on CD-ROM
        in the 1990s. The ubiquitous tabbed interface borrows the metaphor of
        a HyperCard stack.</p>
      <p>Multimedia tools enable a specific user interface to be designed that
        allows an end-user to browse information that may be text, audio, images,
        video or any other data type. One problem with most multimedia tools
        is that they encapsulate the data into a format that may only be used
        in that very specific way. This is not so much a fault of these early
        tools, since most allowed data to be kept in external files. This inconvenience
        stemmed from the lack of any standard way of browsing a collection of
        arbitrary data types, beyond the basic file system.</p>
      <h3>The influence of the web</h3>
      <p>The web spread widely through the 1990s. At last there was a widely
        adopted format for documents that allowed linking and embedding of other
        documents and media types. However, what was introduced primarily as
        a system for creating indexes, grew unwieldy when used as a format for
        displaying large amounts of information and it was not well-suited to
        create the tools needed to navigate and make sense of it all.</p>
      <p>As the web matured, large web sites migrated their information into
        databases, yet most continued to use HTML, not only for basic indexing,
        but as the front end for applications. The first web applications were
        very simple. With all the complexity of a dialogue box, the simple question
        and answer model was well-suited to HTML Forms. As web applications attempted
        to display better views of large amounts of data and allow people to
        ask more complex questions, the user experience grew cumbersome. Where
        the web initially offered a feeling of boundless exploration with interesting
        places linked across the world, it can now entangle a hapless end-user
        in a series of mundane questions that fail to yield satisfying results.</p>
      <h3>What now? </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;The capacity of digital data storage worldwide has doubled every
          nine months for at least a decade, at twice the rate predicted by Moore's
          Law for the growth of computing power during the same period<sup>2</sup>.
          ... The aggressive rate of growth of disk storage and the gap between
          Moore's Law and Storage Law growth trends represents a very interesting
          pattern in the state of technology evolution. Our ability to capture
          and store data has far outpaced our ability to process and utilize
          it.&quot;<sup>3</sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Storing and archiving information in databases provides an opportunity
        to separate the user interface from the data itself -- easily allowing
        multiple views on the data. Client-server architectures for database
        access pre-date the web. However, now there exist a few ubiquitous client-side
        technologies along with some helpful server standards that provide a
        higher level platform for solving these problems.</p>
      <p>On the server-side, J2EE made the promise of the global village attainable
        by choosing a Unicode standard. With UTF-8 as the default encoding for
        XML, text has finally moved beyond ascii, enabling not only the exciting
        symbols offered by HTML (&copy;, &reg;, &#8482;, &yen;, &#8212;, &ccedil;, &ntilde;,
        etc.) but also the tens of thousands of characters required to communicate
        with most of the people of the world. These basic standards provide the
        foundation for Web Services which promise to commoditize transactions
        as well as data. Even Microsoft has embraced these standards enabling
        its .NET servers to work and play well with others.</p>
      <p>On the client-side, there is as little diversity, but its more interesting
        than it was in 1993. If everyone you know runs Windows, Microsoft has
        some compelling client-side technology. However, if members of your audience
        use a different operating system, Flash has emerged as the dominant non-Microsoft
        option. While cast in the role of a multimedia player after its adoption
        by Macromedia, it was always and remains a pure internet technology.
        It grew up with the constraints of low bandwidth and what are now considered
        low-speed CPUs. It is runs on most desktop OS's, set-top boxes, and hand-helds.
        It is emerging on even smaller devices, on some phones and even the popular
        i-mode. As with most technology, it is far from perfect, but offers some
        hope that we can create great user experiences that move beyond the constraints
        of HTML. </p>
      <p>Many of the lessons learned from multimedia &quot;content creation&quot; can
        now be applied to the design of how people view information and ask questions
        about that information. A graphical user infterface is, after all, information
        design. We now have the opportunity to design better ways to allow people
        to grasp what information is available and select what they want to see.
        The time has come for a next generation user interface.</p>

      <p>About Sarah Allen</p>
      <p>My introduction to interactive multimedia was through an educational
        software seminar led by Prof. Andries van Dam at Brown University in
        1988. We learned Course of Action (later called Authorware), VideoWorks
        (which became Director) and HyperCard. Later I made key contributions
        to both Shockwave and Flash, and along the way gained experience with
        perhaps every multimedia authoring tool released since the mid-'80s.</p>
      <p> Sarah Allen began developing Internet software over seven years ago
        as an engineer on Macromedia's Shockwave team, which developed one of
        the first technologies<br>
  to bring moving images and sound to the web. She led the development<br>
  of the Shockwave Multiuser Server, and later the Flash Communication Server,
  introducing streaming video and multi-party communication in Flash Player 6.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining Macromedia, she developed software tools for multimedia,<br>
  digital video, and graphic arts at Adobe, Aldus, and The Company of Science<br>
  and Art (CoSA). She was named one of the top 25 women of the web<br>
  by SF Wow (San Francisco Women of the Web) in 1998.</p></td>
